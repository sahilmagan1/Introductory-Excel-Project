# Introductory Portfolio Project : Excel For Analytics

This project is an example case study of data received from a manager to find quarterly volume of sales, and to complete analysis by comparing it to prior quarters. We begin by determining what information the manager is looking for. Next, we clean the data, and explore it using variance and multiple charts. Finally, we develop an analysis of our findings. 

## Prerequisites

Download the zip from the following link : https://github.com/mattbrattin/Excel-for-Analytics.git

### Installing

Extract the file to your local repository, and and continuously push commits to remote repository to keep track of changes made. Open the file in Microsoft Excel. Save a new file and rename to **"Volume by Region Data Request v1"**.

## Analysis

### Cleaning The Data

1. Begin cleaning the data by creating data tables and filling blank rows. Reformat dates and values to observe the entire table.
2. Check for duplicates.
3. Use VLookup to match Region ID with Clients.
4. Extract Quarters from dates.   

### Pivot Tables

1. Save a new file and rename to **"Volume by Region Data Request v2"**. 
2. Create Pivot Tables of *Quarterly Volume sales by Region*.
3. Use Forecasting and Variance to conduct analysis.
4. Pressure test to confirm analysis.

### Presentation

1. Save a new file and rename to **"Volume by Region Data Request v3"**.
2. Build clean data tables for presentation using *Q1 and Q2 Year-over-Year data*.
3. Add visualization of customers and volume sales.
4. Create doughnut charts and bar graph for active number of customers and volume sales. 
5. Reformat and provide key findings at the bottom of table.


## Key Findings

The data should be able to provide that Q2 Year-over-Year growth slowed from Q1 growth of 4% down to 2.7%, (~13k) in volume primarily driven by:
 - (~7k) volume, or 55% of the total decline from loss of two customers in LATAM, driving overall growth for region down from 9% in Q1 to flat in Q2 YoY
 - NAM client onboarding in Q2 2020 anniversaried in Q2 2021, slowing perceived growth and amplifying Q1 growth by ~5k units, or 1%
